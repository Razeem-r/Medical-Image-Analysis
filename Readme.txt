README
•	All codes are written mainly in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb).

All folders and code necessary to run in Google Collab are here: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yBFNXS7AC-1TR2jAa-SQpsfEq0_jAfYS?usp=sharing

•	Make sure all the files and folders in ‘Open Me’ folder are in the collab directory as well.

•	The MATLAB folder is only to run the Iterative Hough Transform and fit the ellipse as it is very slow in python.
•	Run <scan{1-5}.m> files in MATLAB to fit the ellipse on the scans.
•	 Ensure all files including <ellipseDetection.m> and <ellipse.m> are also in the same directory.

•	If any issues, I’m always ready to run the code in my laptop anytime.
